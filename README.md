Comp Graphic and Visualization

I use the software development lifecycle as an approach to designing software. This includes planning, analysis, design, implementation and maintenance.
Throughout this course, I learned how to create 3-dimenstional graphics, add lighting and texture to it, and then have user input manuever their way around my scene using their keyboard and mouse. Each week we learned a piece of how to create this graphic, and implement it into our individual scenes. We first learned on a pyramid, adding texture and lighting, and user input, and we had to learn how to implement that into our own scenes. 
In my 3-D scene, I recreated my dog's food bowl holder with each food and water bowl. However, to showcase my skills, I did not make two cylinders the bowls, but used a pyramid and hexagonal cylinoid instead.
This course was particularly challenging as there are many ways to go about adding and manipulating shapes in OpenGL, but using each week step by step helped develop skills I can use in future education, building upon each learning block and implementing that into the bigger picture.
